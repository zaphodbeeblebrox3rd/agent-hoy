# macOS ARM (Apple Silicon) Compatibility Fixes

This document summarizes the fixes applied to make the Speech Transcription Application work on macOS ARM systems.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. PyAudio Installation Issue
**Problem**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pyaudio'`
**Root Cause**: PyAudio was commented out in `environment.yaml` and not properly installed for ARM64 architecture.

**Solution**:
1. Install system dependency: `brew install portaudio`
2. Updated `environment.yaml` to include PyAudio via pip:
   ```yaml
   - pip:
     - PyAudio>=0.2.11  # Install via pip for better macOS ARM compatibility
   ```
3. Updated conda environment: `conda env update -f environment.yaml`

### 2. Audio Device Detection
**Result**: Successfully detected multiple audio input devices:
- MacBook Air Microphone (1 channel)
- Microsoft Teams Audio (1 channel) 
- ZoomAudioDevice (2 channels)

### 3. Microphone Permissions
**Status**: ✅ Working
- macOS automatically prompts for microphone permissions when the application first accesses audio
- No additional configuration required
- SpeechRecognition ambient noise adjustment works correctly

## Verification Steps

All tests pass successfully:
```bash
conda activate agent-hoy
python test_setup.py
```

Expected output:
- ✓ Python version is recommended  
- ✓ Running in conda environment: agent-hoy
- ✓ All required and optional modules
- ✓ Microphone access successful
- ✓ GUI components working

## Dependencies Successfully Installed

- **PyAudio 0.2.14**: Audio capture and playback
- **SpeechRecognition 3.14.3**: Speech recognition framework
- **portaudio**: System-level audio library (via Homebrew)

## Application Launch

The main application now starts successfully:
```bash
conda activate agent-hoy
python main.py
```

## Notes for Future Development

1. **PyAudio Installation**: For macOS ARM, always install via pip rather than conda
2. **System Dependencies**: Ensure `portaudio` is installed via Homebrew first
3. **Permissions**: macOS will automatically request microphone permissions on first use
4. **Alternative Libraries**: If PyAudio issues persist, consider using `sounddevice` as an alternative

## Testing Completed

- [x] PyAudio import and initialization
- [x] Audio device enumeration
- [x] Microphone object creation
- [x] Ambient noise adjustment
- [x] SpeechRecognition integration
- [x] GUI application launch

All microphone-related functionality is now working correctly on macOS ARM systems.
